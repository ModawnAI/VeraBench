Beauty Treatment
Beauty treatments is the broad category that encompass all services and treatments aimed at enhancing physical appearance, grooming, and relaxation. They include both basic, non-medical services (e.g., facials, waxing) and more advanced procedures like cosmetic treatments.

Examples: Basic facials, hair styling, manicures, makeup application, body scrubs, etc.


Aesthetic Treatment
Aesthetic treatments fall under the broader category of beauty treatments but are distinct in their focus on advanced, medical-grade procedures. They represent the professional, high-tech side of the beauty industry, compared to the everyday, non-medical services found in salons and spas.

Vera focuses on aesthetic treatments, NOT the broader beauty treatments.

Examples: Advanced facials, Botox, fillers, peels, laser skin resurfacing, liposuction, rhinoplasty.
